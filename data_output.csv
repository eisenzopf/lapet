agent: Hello, thank you for reaching Union Mobile. My name is Mimi, how can I assist you today?
client: Hi Mimi, I'm calling about my VPN for Privacy. I'm concerned about the strength of the encryption used by the VPN. Can you help me with that?
agent: Of course, Charlotte. I understand your concern. Let me check on that for you. (brief pause) Yes, our VPN for Privacy uses 256-bit AES encryption, which is the highest level of encryption available. It's the same level used by many financial institutions and government agencies.
client: That's great to hear. Can you tell me more about how it encryption works?
agent: Sure thing! Our VPN for Privacy creates a secure, encrypted connection between your device and our servers. This means that all data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it. And, since we use 256-bit AES encryption, it would take an incredibly powerful computer millions of years to crack the code.
client: Wow, that's impressive. I feel much better now. Thank you so much for your help, Mimi.

client: Hi Mimi, I'm calling about my VPN for Privacy. I'm concerned about the strength of the encryption used by the VPN. Can you help me with that?
agent: Of course, Charlotte. I understand your concern. Let me check on that for you. (brief pause) Yes, our VPN for Privacy uses 256-bit AES encryption, which is the highest level of encryption available. It's the same level used by many financial institutions and government agencies.
